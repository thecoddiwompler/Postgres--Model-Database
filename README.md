# Postgres Model Database

This project initiates the Postgres database server, establishes the Model Employee database (utilizing a large dataset from MySQL official documentation), and ingests data into it. The data model is constructed, and data is ingested via SQL scripts found in the sample_db folder.

To build the project, download the repository and execute the following command to create the model database:
<br>
  ```bash
  docker compose up
  ```
